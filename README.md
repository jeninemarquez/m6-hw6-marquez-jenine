Resources: In addition to the recorded and live lecture, I used the following links:
To complete steps 2, 3, and 4: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-addeventlistener-with-examples/
To complete step 1: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8318591/javascript-addeventlistener-using-to-create-a-mouseover-effect

Issues: It mainly just took me time to get used to how event listeners are written and when to add the for loops in the functions. By going back to the live lecture, I had a better understanding of how to get steps 1 and 5 to work.
